# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A Python-based data analysis and visualization project that tracks COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations worldwide using data from Our World in Data.

## Objectives

- Analyze global COVID-19 trends over time
- Visualize country-level comparisons of cases and vaccinations
- Create interactive maps to show geographic distribution
- Provide up-to-date insights on the pandemic

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3
- Pandas (data manipulation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization)
- Plotly (interactive maps)
- Google Colab (execution environment)

## How to Run/View the Project

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/[your-username]/covid-19-tracker/blob/main/covid19_tracker.ipynb)
2. Run all cells sequentially
3. Alternatively, view the notebook directly on GitHub

## Insights

1. The visualization shows how COVID-19 cases evolved in waves over time
2. Vaccination rates vary significantly between countries
3. Some countries with high case counts also have high vaccination rates
4. The interactive map reveals geographic patterns in case distribution

## Future Enhancements

- Add forecasting models
- Include more detailed regional data
- Create a dashboard interface
- Automate daily data updates
